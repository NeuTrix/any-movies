# README

** Starting the application

- To run both React and Rails, in terminal at the application root run `foreman start`
- TO just run the React frontend, in the `/client` for React, run `yarn start`
- For just the Rails api, in the root, run `rails s -p 3001`.  This runs rails on PORT=3001 and aligns with the React Proxy code (avoid CORS issues).
